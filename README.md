# multithreading
Just a java multithreading example

I have added this for reference


Imp points

1) advantage of implmenting runnable interface over extending Thread class is that 
   multiple inheritance is possible in interface....but not in thread
   
   eg Myclass extends Thread            //no other extends or implements
      MyClass extends class1 implements runnable,otherinterface
